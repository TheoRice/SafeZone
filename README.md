# SafeZone

## In order to work without connection to database, comment out lines 221-239 in main.js

#### To Do: 
* Integrate bootstrap/jquery to front end
* Add a login system using facebook API (to check for rpi.edu address)
* Potentially refactor main.js using gmaps.js library
* Authentification feature
* Add info windows to markers on screen (low priority, mainly for testing)
* Try to show the number of similar markers in an area (for potential merge into 1 marker)
